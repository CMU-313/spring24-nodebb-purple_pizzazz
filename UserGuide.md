# New Features

## Account type markers
Upon creating an account, users have the ability to select between an "Instructor" account and a "Student" account. Previously, this did not display anywhere. Now, upon sending a message, there is a box for the user's account type right next to the username.
You can test this manually by simply making an account and making a new post; the marker should show up. In addition, it can be tested using the tests in tests/posts.js under "Account Type". These tests check that the user's account type is correctly stored in a post, which means that the front-end will be able to pull it up. The tests check both possible account types (instructor and student), so the tests added are sufficient.
